SpaceLink Enterprise Gateway
Overview

SpaceLink Enterprise Gateway is an enterprise-grade network telemetry and API integration platform inspired by Starlink Enterprise onboarding workflows. The project simulates how global enterprises, governments, and partners integrate Starlink into existing network environments using secure APIs, telemetry ingestion, and DevOps-first deployment practices.

This repository is designed as a technical sales proof-of-concept (POC) and reference implementation—the same artifacts a Technical Sales Architect would use to accelerate customer adoption, support RFIs, and collaborate with product engineering teams.

Business Problem

Enterprises adopting satellite connectivity (e.g., Starlink) do not simply “plug in” a terminal. They require:

Real-time network telemetry

Secure API access for automation

SLA visibility and alerting

Partner and channel onboarding workflows

Integration with existing NOCs, dashboards, and tooling

SpaceLink addresses these requirements by providing a software-defined integration layer that sits between Starlink-like connectivity and enterprise systems.
